<p>This histogram shows the frequency of car ownership by faculty members.  Sixty-four faculty
members were surveyed and asked how many cars each owned.  The number of cars owned is displayed along
the X-axis, with the relative frequency of each response displayed on the Y-axis.  The results are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Zero percent of the faculty members reported owning no car at all</li>
  <li>Approximately 15% of the faculty members reporting owning exactly one car</li>
  <li>Approximately 45% of the faculty members reporting owning exactly two cars</li>
  <li>Approximately 25% of the faculty members reporting owning exactly three cars</li>
  <li>Zero percent of the faculty members reported owning between four and six cars</li>
  <li>Approximately 15% of the faculty members reporting owning exactly seven cars</li>
</ul>
